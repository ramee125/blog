                            A description of Bharatanatyam from the 2nd century CE can be found in the ancient Tamil
                            epic
                            Silappatikaram, while temple sculptures of the 6th to 9th century CE suggest it was a
                            highly
                            refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE. Bharatanatyam is the oldest
                            classical
                            dance tradition in India.Bharatanatyam is the state dance form of Tamil Nadu.

                            Bharatanatyam contains different types of banis. Bani, or 'tradition', is a term used to
                            describe the dance technique and style specific to a guru or school. These are named
                            according
                            to the village of the guru (with the exception of some banis. Bharatanatyam style is
                            noted for
                            its fixed upper torso, bent legs and knees flexed (Aramandi) combined with spectacular
                            footwork,
                            and a sophisticated vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and
                            face
                            muscles. The dance is accompanied by music and a singer, and typically the dancer's guru
                            is
                            present as the Nattuvanar, director, and conductor of the performance and art. The
                            performance
                            repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances, includes nrita (pure dance),
                            nritya

                            Bharatanatyam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century.It was banned
                            by the
                            colonial British government in 1910, but the Indian community protested against the ban
                            and
                            expanded its performance outside temples in the 20th century.Modern stage productions of

                            different
                            ways and have incorporated technical performances, pure dance based on non-religious
                            ideas and
