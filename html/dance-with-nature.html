                            <p>The story of Devol Madu shanthikarmaya is related to King Seerimana. In the Chola Empire,
                                the king's garden was deserted and the king's orders were executed by the to kill the
                                pregnant sacks. While pursuing these sacks, he slipped into a pond near the sack and
                                died of hatred for the king. Later, the bull was born in the same pond. One day while
                                the king was watching the garden, he broke a beautiful blue lily in a nearby pond and
                                smelled it. The little frog, hiding under the flower, instantly plunged into the king's
                                nose pierced, causing the king to fall sick. The king had a severe headache, and the
                                doctors treated him with various remedies, but there was no cure. In time the king saw a
                                beautiful woman in a dream. It was now known to the ancestors of the king, who thought
                                that the king had seen in his dreams the goddess Pathwini and that the king had a curse
                                on her. In order to overcome the curse, the Brahman’s idea was to go to a country with
                                Buddhism and pay homage to the goddess Pathwini . History records that the first Devol
                                Madhu Yoga was held at Sri lanka, the ideal country. As a result of this, the king's
                                headache was healed and legends tell us that from that time on, the Devol Madu
                                shanthikarmaya was established in Sri Lanka as well.
