                            <p>Kohomba Kankariya or the Kohomba Yak Kankariya is the main ritual or the Shanthi
                                Karma,which is performed in the Kandyan dance tradition to invoke blessings from the
                                deities or gods known as the New Kohomba, the old Kohomba, the great Kohomba. Moreover
                                the Black prince (Kalu Kumara), Ambarapati (Pattini), God Weeramunda, God Kadawara,
                                Kudaguru, Mahaguru,and the group of 36 ancestors of veddhasor Adivasi are also included
                                here. Kohomba Kankariya is traditionally associated with the circle of harvesting in the
                                country. After gathering the bountiful harvest from the paddy cultivation, people
                                worship deities and gods by offering the first portion of the harvest to gods in order
                                to express their gratitude to gods for giving them a bountiful harvest. In order to
                                bring prosperity to the village, to prevent the spread of diseases, to cure a person
                                from an illness and to get prosperity in animal breeding are the other reasons to hold
                                this ritualistic performance. This ritualistic performance is associated with variety of
                                folk and popular Buddhist practices. It is said that in the past, the kohomba Yak
                                Kankariya was performed for about Seven days, but today it is limited to one day.
