                            <p>The "Daha Ata Sanniya" is a traditional dance ritual held to exorcise 18 types of
                                diseases from the human body. Though an extremely colourful and vibrant pageant, most
                                Sri Lankans do not get the chance of witnessing it, due to the performance's exorbitant
                                costs and the long duration.
                            </p>

                                The origin of this Shanthi Karmaya (blessing) took place in the times of ancient kings
                                and was performed in the southern and western parts of the country. According to the
                                story, while King Sankapala was at war, his wife who was pregnant had a sudden craving
                                for a certain variety of mango. As she ate it, her maid of honour too had wanted a piece
                                of the fruit, but had been refused by the Queen. Angry at this refusal, the maid cursed
                                her and when the King returned after the war, told him that the Queen had conceived out
                                of wedlock. The story was believed and the Queen was sliced in two with a sword. The
                                baby was born and ate off his mother and so, a devil was born. As the story goes, lead
                                by this devil, 18 other devils were created and they in turn came to towns and cities
                                and began to spread in the form of diseases. It is to counter this type of sickness that
                                the Daha Ata Sanniya originated.

                                'Daha Ata Sanniya" will be performed in two sections where the first part will consist
                                of seven palis, while the second part will be performed as the 18 sannis.

                                The mask known as Dahaata Sanniya or ‘eighteen disease’ is studded with 18 diseased
                                faces atop a pair of their gods and two spirits one the spreader of pain through disease
                                and other the saviour is placed vertically apart. Prof. M.H. Goonatilleka explained that
                                in folk religion this is in vogue. He explained that "Pritiatory magical and therapeutic
                                effects of mask and attendant rituals of Sri Lanka are still not forgotten in the remote
                                parts of the country. The dancer donning demon masks may not be aware of the
                                significance of ritual transformation and the assumption of the role of the
                                disease-causing demon."
